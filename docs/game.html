        <p>The game "Carbon Steel" by Mike Klubnika, developer of another game that blew up on
            social media known as "Buckshot Roulette", is an horror game that really focuses on the
            atmosphere. It takes place in some sort of dystopia that involves creature
            investigation. The player will likely feel lonely in the facility that the game takes
            place in. The game tasks the player with collecting data from creatures from the depths,
            and gives more tasks as the days go on.</p>

        <p><a href="https://embed.kumu.io/a4d4d29f587b04b424ce97a6bb1f9fec">Link</a> in case the
            embed doesn't work.</p>
        <p>In the beginning of the game, the player is standing in front of an identity verification
            desk and there is no face behind the counter, just a black abyss. The player is taken to
            their objective on some sort of monorail by a silent driver. The facility seems to be
            very old and neglected, as the walls are covered in rust and mostly brown, red and grey.
            After arriving at the entrance of the facility labeled #52, the only sign of life other
            than the transporter of the cart is a camera that tracks the player. Once the player
            approaches the door with the camera, the door opens after the player looks at the
            camera.</p>
        <p>Upon entering the room there is a retro computer and another monitor on the side, with an
            engineer working on the machine behind it that the player will control in the next few
            minutes. The room is very dark and the only light sources are the computer and the
            sparks that the engineer is creating. On said computer there is an email from the higher
            ups in the facility that will brief the player on what will be happening in the coming
            days. This game takes place over only three days. The only thing left to do to progress
            is to sleep in the bedroom off to the side. Once the player wakes up, this is where the
            game is no longer just creating atmosphere.</p>
        <p>As stated previously, the game takes place over three days with emails telling the player
            what to do for objectives. The main objective is to identify creatures from the depths
            and create the proper anesthesia for said subject to allow for data collection. The only
            communication the player has is between the higher ups and the engineer later on. The
            objectives each day increase in number until the final day.</p>

        <p>The game is fairly quiet and uses mostly sound effects rather than music. It utilizes a
            lot of mechanical noises and things that you would likely hear in an old factory. The
            music used in the last day is interesting, as personally I thought it was kind of a jam.
            It uses the banging of the creature within the pod as part of the beat and it was
            honestly catchy. The song almost sounds aquatic, which seems to be where the creatures
            come from. </p>
        <p>I believe that the game may be a possible future if we as humans were to go too far for
            the sake of science and will choose to risk others lives for the sake of science.
            Considering that they perform a data collection on the player themselves if the player
            chooses to keep helping the higher ups, this shows that they simply want to test the
            limits of what they can do. On the other hand others around the facility, like the
            engineer, want to help those who will be simply used by the facility. If the player
            chooses to listen to the engineer's email on the second day, the player can leave the
            facility seemingly unharmed.</p>
        <p>Overall, I really enjoyed the game's atmosphere and idea. This game is also part of a
            short horror game collection that is five games in total all by Mike Klubnika. I highly
            recommend this game for anyone looking for a short horror experience.</p>
