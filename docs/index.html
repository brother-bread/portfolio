        <p>I am currently a junior at Penn State Behrend and I am a DIGIT major. I love playing
            videogames and taking pictures of nature. I also recently started playing guitar. I have
            lived in Erie Pennsylvania my whole life, but have travelled across the country and
            visited many states.</p>
        <p>I enjoy learning about code and how it works, even if I am not good at understanding
            everything yet. I am also interested in design and three dimensional modeling.</p>
        <p><strong>The courses I have taken so far pertaining to my major are:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Art 168: The Digital Medium</li>
            <li>DIGIT 100: Introduction to Digital Humanities</li>
            <li>MIS 387: Website Design</li>
        </ul>
        <p>DIGIT 100 and Art 168 are crucial in understanding the basics of the DIGIT field. MIS 387
            is important as a side course not only for a graduation requirement for the major, but
            for understanding the process of designing a website.</p>
