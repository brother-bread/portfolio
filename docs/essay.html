        <p>I was really confused at first with understanding how github worked, and I still am a
            little bit. I would say the biggest challenge is just understanding the basics, but once
            those are mostly understood, the development part is easy. Understanding what something
            does is somewhat easy in html editors and Word Press, as most of the things are
            explained or hinted towards in the case of html editors. A lot of html development can
            be helped by simply looking something up.</p>
        <p>The advantages of Word Press are clear in the fact that there is not really any direct
            coding involved and thus people not looking to get involved in the field will not have
            to worry about understanding it. Word Press does encourage some slight understanding of
            coding when looking at images, but you don’t need to know what it means. For example, it
            just gives you the options for alt text. The html editor Oxygen was pretty new
            user-friendly and helps out a lot by giving options while typing in styling or other
            things. Many html editors use this and can potentially be more interactive in website
            development. When directly editing html you have much more freedom as compared to Word
            Press, which is not exactly as you want it (as easy anyways) but can be potentially be
            easier for those who have no coding experience.</p>
        <p>As mentioned previously, I struggled with editing the layout and appearance of the
            website on Word Press. This is partially due to being frustrated with the loading time
            when checking how something may look. Changing the appearance through an html editor can
            be extremely challenging but can be very personalized comparatively. You can essentially
            make the website look however you want, if you know how to code it.</p>
        <p>In terms of skills, you need to have both patience and a taste for design and appearance.
            When developing a website, you do not want it to appear ugly, and want it to be
            appealing for anyone visiting it. When developing Word Press however, significantly less
            skill and understanding is required when compared to html editing.</p>
        <p>I really want to get better at designing websites through html, and understanding what
            more things do. I feel as though my website doesn’t look the best it could, and I can
            definitely improve it. The problem I have with learning anything, is that if it looks
            too difficult, it really discourages me from trying it, but when I do try it can
            potentially be really fun. I just struggle with that starting point.</p>
